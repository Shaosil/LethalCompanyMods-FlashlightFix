# FlashlightFix

This fixes the following issues:

<ul>
	<li>The flashlight toggles on or off when being placed in the ship cupboard.</li>
</ul>

And <i>possibly</i> fixes other, similar problems, like:
<ul>
	<li>The flashlight toggling itself off when using/switching items and picking things up</li>
	<li>The flashlight draining battery when it is not in use</li>
	<li>And more?</li>
</ul>

If this mod does <i>not</i> fix the extra described issues, I will do my best to troubleshoot the problem(s) and update it.
